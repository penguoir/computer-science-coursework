Solution requirements
=====================

In this section, I specify and justify the requirements for the proposed
solution, including hardware and software requirements.

Hardware
--------

The basic hardware required to run the software is a server which has an
internet connection and is capable of running Ruby. A server is required to
serve a web page (around which the solution is built). An internet connection is
required because the webpage is served online. Further, the computer should be
able to run Ruby as the code is written in Ruby.

[According to Cloud66][1], minimum requirements to run Rails are:

  * 2GB of RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 25GB of storage

[1]: https://help.cloud66.com/rails/references/non-recommended-server-sizes.html

As the soluton is a basic Rails service, using these requirements is a good
starting point for a server. My school has an in-house server which could run
this server wihout a problem. An online platform could partition this amount of
memory / processing time to the server, too.

There are advantages and disadvantages to using the cloud, as well as using an
on-site server.

### On-site server

**Definition:** A server that is inside the school premises which runs the website
code.

This solution has several advantages including:

  * easily change code,
  * full customizability,
  * base ongoing cost is cheaper,
  * hardware upgrade capabilities,
  * security is well-defined,

and more.

All of these advantages come from the fact that the server is _physically_
closer to the IT team. However, there are some disadvantages too:

  * Scaling is complicated and expensive
  * Security must be dealt with
  * Maintenance is expensive and requiers on-site workers, especially if has to
    have 24/7 availability

These are all issues of a _self-managed_ operation, and are inevitable when
working with an on-premises computer.

### Cloud server

Definition: A **logical server** that is built, hosted, and delivered through a
cloud platform over the internet. [source][technopedia]

[techopedia]: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29019/cloud-server

A logical server can be defined as a "virutal" server as it can scale up and
down onto many machines. In other words, it's not just a single computer.

Cloud servers have the benefit of being managed by a massive company (e.g.
Google). This means that they must comply with security regulations, and have
the budget to have top-notch security without being to expensive.

These companies also take on the cost of maintenance, which means that payment
is either constant, or scales depending on server usage. If a website suddenly
gets an influx of customers, the server simply scales to more machines to match
the requests (for an increased price). This means that the server won't just
crash if there's a sudden influx.

Code can be uploaded to the servers using a version-control software like Git,
or by uploading files using FTP. This means that changing the code on the server
is efficient.

### Summary table

To summarise these points, I used this table:

| Section           | On-site Server      | Cloud server | 
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Speed             | Depends on hardware | Depends on pricing tier |
| Performance       | Depends on hardware | Fast |
| Ongoing price     | Cheap, but requires dedicated employees | Very cheap |
| Installation cost | Expensive           | Free (usually) |
| Security          | Difficult to implement, but possible | Guarenteed |
| Customizability   | Complete            | Almost copmlete |
| Code changing     | Easy                | Easy |

### Conclusion

For this project, I chose to use a Cloud server. I chose to use Heroku which is
a SaaS that provides logical servers. They have a great code updating system
which takes code automatically from Github or any other Git provider. This means
that the system always has the latest version of software.

For that reason, and for the reasons stated above, I chose to use Heroku to host
my website.

Software
--------

As the propsed solution is quite large, I chose to use a well-established
framework called "Ruby on Rails" ("Rails") to build my site. Rails has great
developer experience, with almost every question answered on their documentation
website. This means that I could quickly learn how to use the framework and
start building.

Rails includes "generators" which can build a large part of boilerplate code
with a single command line. This saves on development time and prevents bugs.

Another feature of Rails is it's MVC architecture. Each resource in the site has
its own model, view, and controller. This seperation of concerns helps keep
developers focused on their task, and also keeps the project maintainable, even
with many different files.

Rails's abstraction of SQL statements makes code readable and maintainable. For
example, instead of writing an SQL statement like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2;
```

the following can be written:

```ruby
User.find(2)
```

Although a knowledge of SQL is still required, this simplifies the code and
