This section describes and justifies the research I did into existing solutions
of a project-based learning management system.


Existing solutions
------------------

### Canvas by Instructure

My school uses [Canvas][canvas] to manage the assignments and resources of
courses in the school. It is a well-established system (with over [30 million
users!][canvas-users-article]) so I conducted a thourough analysis of it.

#### Trying out different user flows

##### Initial impressions

First, I created a sandbox account on the instructure site. This was completely
fine, although I was forced to sign up for a newsletter.

Next, I was greeted with this screen:

![first screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penguoir/computer-science-coursework/master/resources/images/first_screen.png)

There is loads of content everywhere, and I don't really know where to start.

There are three different sidebars. The first one seems to have some links to my
account, my courses, my calendar, inbox, history, commons and help:

This is not really clear. How is the dashboard different than the courses? Also,
each item does a different action. For example: Pressing "Courses" opens a menu
with all my courses (which becomes cumbersome when there are more than ten).
"History" also opens a sidebar, but the others all are links to pages.

I noted that it is important to have a more consistent user interface in my own
project.

##### Creating a course

This is a common task at the start of every year. Administrators create courses
for each teacher's class, and assign the teacher and the students of that class
to the course.

In this case, I'd like to see what it's like to start a new course:

First, I press on "Courses" and "+ Course". I'm prompted to put in a course name
and content license. Once I enter these and press "Create course" I am greeted
with a screen with loads of options:

The sidebar alone has 20 links! Even as a computer science student this is
baffling, let alone for a less tech-savvy teacher.

There is a big button that says "Create a new module" so I'll press that.

![new module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penguoir/computer-science-coursework/master/resources/images/new_module.png)

In terms of user experience, this screen is terrible! What does the "Lock until"
checkbox mean? And, where is the label for the module name? I type in the module
name and press "Add Module".

Now, I can upload files to add them to the module. This is great because a
teacher has a clear indication of what to do next.

After adding some homework files, I assume that students can access the course
easily.

##### Setting an assignment

I'd like to set an assignment to my imaginary class, so I press on the
"Assignments" tab in my course.

On the right of the screen, a popup comes out which explains the assignment
setting process, and gives links to more guides. If I don't know what to do
next, I have a clear next step--great!

![assignments help popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penguoir/computer-science-coursework/master/resources/images/assignment_help_popup.png)

I press the "+ Assignment" button to create a new assignment.

There are many options on this page, and it spans several scrolls:

![new assignment screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penguoir/computer-science-coursework/master/resources/images/new_assignment.png)

However, options only reveal themselves if applicable. For example, only if I
select "This is a Group Assignment" do I get additional settings for group
assignments. This means teachers aren't completely overwhelmed with options.

Once I press "Save and Publish", I see the assignment and can edit it, see
submissions, etc.

This flow is efficient and simple to do, but there are lots of options a teacher
could get lost in.


##### Creating a shared resource

In project-based learning, students should be able to share reesources with
eachother freely. This promotes the idea of shared knowledge, where the class
uses eachother's knowledge to build new knowledge together, with the aid of a
teacher.




The teacher I interviewed enjoys many parts of the school's existing LMS. They
think it:

  * has many features that allow for interactivity with students
  * allows reviewing student's work without taking in physical papers,

However, they find that the existing LMS:

  * is unintuitive 
  * requires practice to learn, which takes time that they don't have
  * doesn't have a way for students to have a say in the course
