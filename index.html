<h2 id="problem-identification">1 Problem Identification</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I have been trying to learn French. I have used a range
of apps, studied the dictionary, learned the grammar, the lot. And still, I
cannot speak French. Why is it that when I went to France for a week, I felt my
confidence in the language skyrocket? </p>

<p>Well, immersion in the language is probably why. Because I was surrounded by
French, I learned French better.</p>

<p>What if this were possible with maths? Or chemistry? </p>

<p>Imagine travelling to a world where everyone only spoke in physics. Let’s call
it “physics land”. Being immersed in the culture and language of the place means
that you will learn physics much faster and more effectively than someone
learning in a boring classroom. You are immersed in physics! </p>

<p>“Physics land” might sound too good to be true but with an approach called
project-based learning, teachers can get close to sending their students on a
trip there. </p>

<p>In project-based learning, instead of being spoon-fed information, groups of
students are given a massive, real-world task, which they work on for an
extended period. Through working on that task, they understand how to use
different resources and tools related to the subject being taught. Project based
learning drives students to encounter the core ideas and principles of a
subject. </p>

<p>About 4 years ago, I was part of a pilot where my school at the time tried out
project-based learning. My group’s task was to design a school from scratch.
This might seem excessive for a team of 12-year old’s, but it was quite possibly
the most useful learning I have ever done. Budgeting, planning, project
management, teamwork, presentations. All these real-world problems we had to
constantly work through in time for a deadline. We also had to work almost
entirely by ourselves—we had a teacher mentoring, but they only guided us and
didn’t hold our hand the whole way through. </p>

<p>One of the things I loved about it is that I knew why I was learning things. I
didn’t just have to memorize the properties of different timbers for a GCSE
exam, I had to learn it so that I would know which one to use for the floors of
the classrooms. I didn’t have to learn how to use Excel because my IT teacher
told me to, I had to learn it so I could keep track of the imaginary school’s
budget. </p>

<p>Also, in this project, we had little to no help from our teachers, we were
completely independent. We had to direct ourselves and plan our time well to
make sure we hit our deadline. Giving this independence made us want to go above
and beyond, to show our true potential, and gave us experience in real-world
time management. </p>

<p>Another advantage is the teamwork aspect of the project. I was in a group with
people I didn’t really know, this gave me experience in collaborating with
people outside my comfort circle, a skill which is sought after in today’s
globalized environment.</p>

<p>Right now, the standard teaching technique emphasizes repetition and
reinforcement—basically, practice and tests. However, many philosophers and
educational pioneers are arguing that students best learn when they build
knowledge for themselves, they use their experiences with the world to create
new knowledge. This idea is called constructivism and it has been proven to be a
much more effective way of learning new things. Rather than just being told how
the world works, you find out for yourself. </p>

<p>My school is implementing project-based learning for a select few years. Using a
new system which is bulit specifically for PBL would be beneficial to teachers
and students.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-problem-solvable-by-computational-methods">2 Why is the problem solvable by computational methods?</h2>
<p>This proposal has a number of features which lend themselves to being solved by
a computer. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>having many people involved,</li>
<li>consistent constraints,</li>
<li>the parallel nature of accessing data,</li>
<li>a level of security needed,</li>
<li>a level of privacy needed,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="many-people-involved">2.1 Many people involved</h3>
<p>This proposal focuses around a school. In state-funded secondary schools in the
UK, there are approximately 986 students per school, with approximately 523 of
them being in key stage 3 [<a href="#fn1">1</a>].</p>

<p>The large number of students per school means that a paper-based or other manual
solution wouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable. There are simply too many things to constantly
change and manage.</p>

<p>Computers can use databases such as SQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB to save and edit
large amounts of data with microsecond latency. Backups can be made which make
sure the contents aren&rsquo;t lost, and security updates are always being made to
combat hackers or malicious users. Most of these database softwares use extreme
programming which uses short iteration cycles to provide constant updates to the
users, meaning that bugs and exploits are quickly patched.</p>

<p>In this section, I specify and justify the requirements for the proposed
solution, including hardware and software requirements.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">7.1 Hardware</h3>
<p>The basic hardware required to run the software is a server which has an
internet connection and is capable of running Ruby. A server is required to
serve a web page (around which the solution is built). An internet connection is
required because the webpage is served online. Further, the computer should be
able to run Ruby as the code is written in Ruby.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.cloud66.com/rails/references/non-recommended-server-sizes.html">According to Cloud66</a>, minimum requirements to run Rails are:</p>

<ul>
<li>2GB of RAM</li>
<li>4 vCPUs</li>
<li>25GB of storage</li>
</ul>

<p>As the soluton is a basic Rails service, using these requirements is a good
starting point for a server. My school has an in-house server which could run
this server wihout a problem. An online platform could partition this amount of
memory / processing time to the server, too.</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using the cloud, as well as using an
on-site server.</p>
<h4 id="on-site-server">7.1.1 On-site server</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A server that is inside the school premises which runs the website
code.</p>

<p>This solution has several advantages including:</p>

<ul>
<li>easily change code,</li>
<li>full customizability,</li>
<li>base ongoing cost is cheaper,</li>
<li>hardware upgrade capabilities,</li>
<li>security is well-defined,</li>
</ul>

<p>and more.</p>

<p>All of these advantages come from the fact that the server is <em>physically</em>
closer to the IT team. However, there are some disadvantages too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scaling is complicated and expensive</li>
<li>Security must be dealt with</li>
<li>Maintenance is expensive and requiers on-site workers, especially if has to
have 24/7 availability</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all issues of a <em>self-managed</em> operation, and are inevitable when
working with an on-premises computer.</p>
<h4 id="cloud-server">7.1.2 Cloud server</h4>
<p>Definition: A <strong>logical server</strong> that is built, hosted, and delivered through a
cloud platform over the internet. <a href="technopedia">source</a></p>

<p>A logical server can be defined as a &ldquo;virutal&rdquo; server as it can scale up and
down onto many machines. In other words, it&rsquo;s not just a single computer.</p>

<p>Cloud servers have the benefit of being managed by a massive company (e.g.
Google). This means that they must comply with security regulations, and have
the budget to have top-notch security without being to expensive.</p>

<p>These companies also take on the cost of maintenance, which means that payment
is either constant, or scales depending on server usage. If a website suddenly
gets an influx of customers, the server simply scales to more machines to match
the requests (for an increased price). This means that the server won&rsquo;t just
crash if there&rsquo;s a sudden influx.</p>

<p>Code can be uploaded to the servers using a version-control software like Git,
or by uploading files using FTP. This means that changing the code on the server
is efficient.</p>
<h4 id="summary-table">7.1.3 Summary table</h4>
<p>To summarise these points, I used this table:</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">7.1.4 Conclusion</h4>
<p>For this project, I chose to use a Cloud server. I chose to use Heroku which is
a SaaS that provides logical servers. They have a great code updating system
which takes code automatically from Github or any other Git provider. This means
that the system always has the latest version of software.</p>

<p>For that reason, and for the reasons stated above, I chose to use Heroku to host
my website.</p>
<h3 id="software">7.2 Software</h3>
<p>As the propsed solution is quite large, I chose to use a well-established
framework called &ldquo;Ruby on Rails&rdquo; (&ldquo;Rails&rdquo;) to build my site. Rails has great
developer experience, with almost every question answered on their documentation
website. This means that I could quickly learn how to use the framework and
start building.</p>

<p>Rails includes &ldquo;generators&rdquo; which can build a large part of boilerplate code
with a single command line. This saves on development time and prevents bugs.</p>

<p>Another feature of Rails is it&rsquo;s MVC architecture. Each resource in the site has
its own model, view, and controller. This seperation of concerns helps keep
developers focused on their task, and also keeps the project maintainable, even
with many different files.</p>

<p>Rails&rsquo;s abstraction of SQL statements makes code readable and maintainable. For
example, instead of writing an SQL statement like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>the following can be written:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Although a knowledge of SQL is still required, this simplifies the code and </p>
