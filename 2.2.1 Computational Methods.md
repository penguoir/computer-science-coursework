Why is the problem solvable by computational methods?
=====================================================

This proposal has a number of features which lend themselves to being solved by
a computer. These include:

  * having many people involved,
  * consistent constraints,
  * the parallel nature of accessing data,
  * a level of security needed,
  * a level of privacy needed,
 
Many people involved
--------------------

This proposal focuses around a school. In state-funded secondary schools in the
UK, there are approximately 986 students per school, with approximately 523 of
them being in key stage 3 [^student_statistics_gov_uk].

The large number of students per school means that a paper-based or other manual
solution wouldn't be acceptable. There are simply too many things to constantly
change and manage.

Computers can use databases such as SQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB to save and edit
large amounts of data with microsecond latency. Backups can be made which make
sure the contents aren't lost, and security updates are always being made to
combat hackers or malicious users. Most of these database softwares use extreme
programming which uses short iteration cycles to provide constant updates to the
users, meaning that bugs and exploits are quickly patched.
