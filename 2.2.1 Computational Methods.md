Why is the problem solvable by computational methods?
=====================================================

Managing large projects is a natural part of computers and computer science.
There are many algorithms and procedures which aid people in working on projects
together. The essential features which make this possible are: 

  * Many people involved 
  * Consistent constraints 
  * The parallel nature of accessing data
