Why is the problem solvable by computational methods?
=====================================================

This proposal has a number of features which lend themselves to being solved by
a computer. These include:

  * having many people involved,
  * consistent constraints,
  * the parallel nature of accessing data,
  * a level of security needed and,
  * a level of privacy needed

In this section, I describe and justify each of these features, and explain why
they are amenable to a computational approach.

Many people involved
--------------------

This proposal focuses around a school. In state-funded secondary schools in the
UK, there are approximately 986 students per school, with approximately 523 of
them being in key stage 3 [^student_statistics_gov_uk].

[^student_statistics_gov_uk]: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-pupils-and-their-characteristics

The large number of students per school means that a paper-based or other manual
solution wouldn't be acceptable. There are simply too many things to constantly
change and manage.

Computers can use databases such as SQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB to save and edit
large amounts of data with microsecond latency. Data is ensured to not be lost
as backups can be made. Security updates are always being made to combat hackers
or malicious users. Most database software use extreme programming which uses
short iteration cycles to provide constant updates to the users, meaning that
bugs and exploits are quickly patched. This is different from other approaches
(such as the existing system) which receives scarce updates.

Consistent Constraints
----------------------

Pupils, teachers, and admin all face **the same problems** each year. In other
words, the constraints don't change.

In other environments there may be wide variety between work from one year to
the next. For example, a trading company might develop an internal tool one
year, then move on to building a website the next year. Schools do the same
thing (almost exactly) each year.

This means that a single solution could work for many years, justifying the high
cost of development. Even a small saving in time would be repeated each year,
increasing its effects over time.

The parallel nature of accessing data
-------------------------------------

Since there are many people involved in a school, there will be times where
multiple people are accessing data at the same time. With a computational
approach, multiple threads can be used to split the work, thus answering
multiple user's queries at the same time.

On a single-core computer, time-slicing can be used to give the appearance of
multitasking. This means that each user accessing the data needs to wait less
time. In other words, the computer is fair to all users.

On a multi-core computer, cores can individually deal with requests. Meaning
that the tasks are __really__ done at the same time. Thus, response time is
minimised.

In a traditional approach, such as using a spreadsheet, accessing the same data
at the same time could be difficult. With computers, the process is simple,
thus, using a computational approach for this solution is justified.


Security
--------

A certain level of security is required to keep the users' information secure.
According to Gov.uk [^minimum-cs-security-gov-uk], access to secure data should
only be allowed to authorised individuals.

[^minimum-cs-security-gov-uk]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard

Authorising individuals can be achieved using a username/password system, which
is easily done online. These are much harder to breach than physical security
systems, especially when in use with encrypted passwords and secure databases.

A paper-based approach would be vulnerable to data loss. The proposal could use
backups, making data redundant, thereby preventing data loss. Thus, a
computational approach is better than a paper-based one.

Privacy
-------

Not everyone has to know everything! A paper-based system (as well as the
existing system) allows teachers and administrators to see students' schedule,
homework, grades, etc.

Computers lend themselves to privacy as data can be processed without a human
interacting or learning it. Computers are good for privacy. The system requires
privacy as, for example, some students may not want their teachers to know that
they take curriculum support session.

Thus, using a computational system for the proposed solution is justified.
