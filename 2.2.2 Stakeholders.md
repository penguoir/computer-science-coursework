STARTSPEC
Identified suitable stakeholders for the project
and described them explaining how they will
make use of the proposed solution and why it is
appropriate to their needs.

For each stakeholder:
  * Describe the stakeholder
  * Describe their needs
  * Explain why solution is appropriate to their needs
  * Explain how they'll use the solution

Stakeholders
============

Stakeholders are parties which use the application. In order to best suit their
needs, their use cases need to be considered individually.

The main stakeholders of this project are:

  * Students
  * Teachers
  * Parents
  * Administrators

However, there are other parties involved that may require specific features.
These parties include:

  * Department heads
  * Head of school
  * School board
  * Exam boards

Students
--------

Project-Based Learning is a student-centric approach by nature, so making sure
students are put first in the system is essential. 

Students need to be able to access the system from anywhere and with ease. They
should not have to be present in the school (as they could be sick or working
from home).

Students need to have a clear overview of their active projects.  However, by
nature of Project-Based Learning, students should not be ordered to do things.
They should try to be proactive in their learning and take responsibility for
their work. This means that specific tasks should not be able to be set by
teachers. They should be student-specified.

As students are often working in groups in pbl, a place to communicate
effectively with the group should also be included.

Students should be learning from other students, as well as contributing to the
“collective wisdom” of the class. Functionality for this feature is important as
it is a significant part of the PBL approach.

Teachers
--------

Teachers are people who help students to learn.

To get a better understanding of teacher's needs, I conducted an interview with
the sixth form's politics teacher. [A recording of the interview is available on
GitHub][tak-interview], and [an auto-generated transcript is also
available][tak-transcript]. I decided on an interview as it gives the most
detail of any survey method. Also, most teachers are going to face the same
problems, so conducting an interview with one can give more detail than giving a
questionnaire or survey to many.

First, I identified the teacher's needs with any management system:

  * paperless
  * take in homework
  * some interactivity

However, these don't hold for PBL, as students don't have homework, and
interactivity is done in real life rather than online. Thus, more interviews
had to be done, which will be discussed later.

The teacher I interviewed enjoys many parts of the school's existing LMS. They
think it:

  * has many features that allow for interactivity with students
  * allows reviewing student's work without taking in physical papers,

However, they find that the existing LMS:

  * is unintuitive 
  * requires practice to learn, which takes time that they don't have
  * doesn't have a way for students to have a say in the course

From the interview, I found more people who could help in my project.


  - online feedback may be more accurate
  - needs to be tought to do something on Canvas
  - to understand, you have to _do it_
  - time to experiment, difficult to find time
  - students having a role in managing the course would be "great"
    - right now, 100% organised by the teacher
  - resources uploaded by teacher
  - feed back on the system
  - accidents should be easily undone
  - Onenote class notebook is good
  - collaboration would "definetly" help with learning
  - ownership and responsibility
  - because starting from young age, group work becomes the norm. responsibility
    in the groups makes everyone accountable
  - if you don't do your bit of work, all of us don't do well
  - they have responsibility, they'll hold eachother accountable
  - if group work is "tokenistic", students will just write it off
  - group work is a one-off today, so the students don't care
  - will be good if leading to something concrete


Parents
-------

Parents are naturally involved in their children’s lives. Existing systems have
functionality which enable parents to “check-in” on their children’s work. 

TODO: questionnaire about parent’s role in student education

Head of departments
-------------------

Department heads are people (usually teachers) who are in charge of their
department. They are usually focused on making sure teachers are using the TODO:
meeting with peter about head of department things

Head of school
--------------

The head of school TODO: meeting with Robert about requirements

School board
------------

The school board has very similar requirements to that of the head of school.

Exam boards
-----------

Exam boards play a big role in student education, however, they are out of scope
for this project.  TODO: see if you can get a meeting with someone from aqa or
something
