STARTSPEC
Identified suitable stakeholders for the project
and described them explaining how they will
make use of the proposed solution and why it is
appropriate to their needs.

For each stakeholder:
  * Describe the stakeholder
  * Describe their needs
  * Explain why solution is appropriate to their needs
  * Explain how they'll use the solution

Stakeholders
============

Stakeholders are parties which use the application. In order to best suit their
needs, their use cases need to be considered individually.

The main stakeholders of this project are:

  * students,
  * teachers,
  * parents, and
  * administrators.

However, there are other parties involved that may require additional features.
These parties include:

  * Heads of department
  * School head
  * School board
  * Exam boards (e.g. OCR)

The rest of this section is dedicated to my investigation of each stakeholder's
requiremetns. The last four stakeholders (heads of departments, school head,
school board and exam boards) are not investigated as they are out of the scope
of the project. 

Students
--------

Students are full-time pupils in years 6-8.

Project-Based Learning is a student-centric approach by nature, so making sure
students are put first in the system is critical.

I investigated into students' need using a focus group of four students. Focus
groups give highly specific, but very detailed data. As most students will face
the same challenges, this is a good way of understanding the whole party, thus
obtaining useful data.

Teachers
--------

Teachers are people who help students to learn. Some are full-time, others are
part-time.

To get a better understanding of teacher's needs, I conducted an interview with
the sixth form's politics teacher. [A recording of the interview is available on
GitHub][tak-interview], and [an auto-generated transcript is also
available][tak-transcript]. I decided on an interview as it gives the most
detail of any survey method. Also, most teachers are going to face the same
problems, so conducting an interview with one can give more detail than giving a
questionnaire or survey to many.

As the school has an existing learning management system, I decided to focus the
questions around the teacher's use of that system. This is because I thought
that talking about a completely hypothetical system would not yield good data.
We would talk about the specifics of the system rather than core needs.

First, I identified the teacher's basic needs for management systems:

  * take in homework
  * students can interact (e.g. quizzes)
  * paperless

I then conducted [another interview][sandrine-interview]
([transcript][sandrine-transcript]) which helped me understand some more about
the teachers' needs from a management system.

However, these don't hold for PBL, as students don't have homework, and
interactivity is done in projects rather than online. Thus, more interviews had
to be done.

The teacher I interviewed enjoys many parts of the school's existing LMS. They
think it:

  * has many features that allow for interactivity with students
  * allows reviewing student's work without taking in physical papers,

However, they find that the existing LMS:

  * is unintuitive 
  * requires practice to learn, which takes time that they don't have
  * doesn't have a way for students to have a say in the course

From the interview, I found more people who could help in my project.

Parents
-------

Parents are naturally involved in their childrenâ€™s education.

The parent's main needs are checking their children's attendance, homework, and
grades.

This shouldn't be done __all the time__ as students will feel stress to only
upload perfect things to the system, which isn't the goal: drafts are welcome
too.

Parents will automatically get an email sent to them describing their child's
past work, current activities, etc. This email is sent out once every two weeks
ot not overload the parents with information.

Administratos
-------------

Administrators are IT professionals who are in charge of maintaining the system.

They need:

  * complete control of the system,
  * good user experience, and
  * fast service.

After first logging in using their credentials, admins can use the system. They
then will see a screen where they can manage the database, and any settings that
are implemented. This is so that if a teacher or student has got any trouble
with the system, they can manually fix it either using SQL statements, or with
point-and-click UI systems.

Admins require a graphical user interface. This is so they won't have to learn
special commands to interact with the system. Further, they won't make mistakes
which could compromise or ruin the system this way.
