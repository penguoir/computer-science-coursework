Okay. So I need to know about your tax return so this is from my computer science coursework, right so the idea that I have is to build a sort of canvas for specifically for project based learning how interesting okay. So this whole project-based learning okay fine right so I know like six to eight. 

I think they're doing some TBL things next year June, I don't know who to talk to this the newly appointed director of six to eight so he shares an office with Peter. So you can go and contact him, what's his. I think it's Julian are if you were to email him. 

I'm sure he'd be really happy to kind of talk to you about maybe yeah it's part of the thing. I want to figure out who to talk to you. Yeah, so I I want to get it on the standing of canvas into from like a teacher's perspective okay and also from like a administrative perspective as well. 

I'm not sure how much you deal with that well. I mean, I suppose. I use it as much as other members of. 

Did our first virtual six-four open evening last week, which we did entirely on canvas right tonight, we've got the year 13 parents evening first time ever we're doing it through canvas so I'm using it more than I would have done previously right because of yeah so canvas is now become like the most important thing in our school right so if that was if that was Peter's goal he has achieved it because it's now like we couldn't live without it basically yeah, but it's got so many things going for it yeah, it doesn't. 

A lot of things. I think that we. Didn't realize it could do like what for example. 

Moving or before the lockdown, we basically used it for homework right so to set homework and that was it not all of the teachers were necessarily recording grades on it. I was but I mean, not everyone did mostly people use it as a homework. Like instead of a homework planner kind of thing for students right then because of lockdown we realized that we could do conferencing through it and also different functions like you can do you know, I mean science are very good at this and the rest of us would we're not but like doing quizzes poles like that actually it could be quite an interactive tool, right? 

And yeah and we realize that that we could do that so Peter did a lot of kind of training of staff because there was a real difference. For people could do. So I use it. For admin stuff. So homework grades and that kind of thing. Now marking work I do that on canvas as well. 

Mark work on canvas. Yeah, so how does that work? So you can. So when students upload work onto canvas, so for me, it's normally a Word document. Essays and that kind of thing. Change it and then re-upload it on to Canvas so students can see my comments and that kind of thing. 

Now that I've got an iPad. I I can also just mark directly. You can write on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which is good. So. If it would it basically means is I can go entirely paperless so I don't ever have to take work in which is what I would have done previously now. 

I don't do that at all. So it's all students uploading stuff onto canvas or using one note. Yeah quite a few of my year towards use that. Yeah, I use one number as well. Yeah, no, I never had students who use one look before but the current year 12. 

To it and actually. It's one why is it good Because I can see all of their notes so I can see all of the notes that they take in class which is helpful for me to know whether they are writing enough detail or they're following, you know, what's happening? 

I can see whether they are organized enough or not, so you know, whether they've got a different tab or whatever you call it for different parts of the course, and all of their homework is on there, so I can I again on my iPad just mark on on their page and then that's it. 

They've got all of my comments. So it's it's use it's useful. It's already useful. Okay. What would you say as some of it's weaknesses? 

Tricky. 

Know that it's got that many weaknesses if I'm honest. I I think I don't think this is a weakness of canvas but I think more from me. I don't know that it's necessarily as intuitive as I. Would like and therefore it does take time for me to have to learn how to do things and when you're busy as a teacher. 

You know I don't know if I can be bothered if I'm honest to put the time into work out how to do stuff whereas you know for example, let's take apple products. There's a lot of things wrong with products. I'm sure I am a captive audience for Apple but it's really easy to know how to do something like it feels very intuitive to me. 

So I don't have to watch those of videos or online tutorials to know how to do things. Things just like yeah things just work and I can kind of figure out quite easily whereas that isn't necessarily the case with canvas and again that's probably more about me than it is about canvas, but It is. 

Right? I mean, it is like the products sort of it's it's it's it's on the product to make it easy to learn. I think you know like meters amazing he's like done so many videos and tutorials and things but then I've got to sit there and watch them all and I don't have time for that no no I don't so even though the support is there, you know, unless it's unless I can work it out myself. 

I'm probably not going to do it right you have seminars right to teach training so yeah. Peter does training the whole staff training and then he records or creates a lot of videos so for staff. There is a whole kind of page on on canvas which has like a list of or bank of resources telling us tutorials for how to do various different things which is amazing isn't a really amazing resource it just requires teachers to have the time to look through them yeah and I think that is you know, that's that's difficult so I think what that means is the way that I use canvas is probably quite limited so there's probably so many things that you can do with it yeah, but I don't need you so I would I mean from that to be honest, that's probably similar to my Macbook this is. 

So many things I could do with it I only do the things that I know right I need to do do you think that all the other things that canvas does impede the things that you do use no I don't think it impedes it at all but I just think that probably I could be more creative in how I use it so for example, you know saying to you that there are quite a lot of interactive things that you can do like the quizzes and yeah doing poles and that kind of stuff like I I don't do that, you know, I use it more for admin and then you know doing a canvas conference or now zoom so you know, I could. 

Probably utilize it far more than I do currently do you think students would learn better if you use those methods? 

To surely learn better but I guess it would be another way for me to measure the progress that students are making right so at the moment, you know, I can do that through homework or up from asking them questions, but this would be another kind of diagnostic tool, right? 

I don't think it necessarily would be about learning better but I would also say, you know, I'm different to most teachers here in the I only teach sixth form so you know the way that students learn in the six womb is starting to move a little bit more like university whereas probably if I was teaching gear seven actually doing a quiz or a poll would be quite more useful whereas I'm kind of like no you need to know how to take notes, do you think that it will be like that six year 60? 

I don't know how much of canvas they will use but I think they're definitely they're looking at different ways of assessing the students yeah and you know if there is a way to use canvas or some kind of similar platform to assess students in a different way than I think they'll be useful because. 

You know, it can't just be about how well the students do in tests and exams that's true in in project based learning the way that the assessments are done are just by asking questions about the students learning and they answer them as honestly as they can and then you get graded between sort of how much you've learned and how much you could apply it to a real scenario yeah, so there's no tests at all it's just based on the projects like how much you sort of how much effort you put in different. 

Canvas or some an online tool to capture that feedback that potentially is more accurate than sitting in front of a child and asking them yeah because there's no person yeah exactly so you might be feel free or about saying that you found something difficult or all you know, or whatever it is, so I can see in that respect that that would be quite useful. 

Yes, very all right. I wanted to ask a bit more about training seminars yeah and then actually before that do you know like any more people like I should talk to other than Julia sixth suite yeah. 

Who else? I mean, you potentially could talk to Karen the head of lower school is your sixth as part of her. 

Remit. Project faced learning project based learning the other person you potentially could talk to is Anna Mcwee who is now in charge of EPQ obviously being a project yeah. I'm thinking and actually she's she's moved quite a lot of the EPQ stuff online and on to cameras as well actually so yeah she's probably great all right that's probably enough people to talk yeah so about training terminals yeah so but you say you said that when you use your your iPhone Apple product you find those very intuitive all right, so you don't watch any tutorials on it and that saves you time yeah right and then with canvas it's not like that no it's a bit more challenging feel like I need to be told. 

Okay and then a training seminar do you think that's the best way to do that? I think you kind of need not like most things I think you need to do it so like watching a video and somebody telling you how to do something is obviously important but you've also got a kind of try out yourself right and do it probably a few times so yeah, so I think I think the seminars are useful and then I as a teacher. 

I feel like I kind of need time. To kind of experiment and explore and it's difficult to find the time to do that, you know during busy days and then it's like you're gonna have to do it during your holiday playing around on campus which is like not really day, so it's yeah, so I think the time thing is is tricky but I suppose. 

What would you think about students doing that so if you if you gave some extra functionality to a few select students in the class and then they would be in charge of making their course as useful as possible to the rest of the students into themselves. Yeah yeah, so I mean yeah that would be great because at the moment they don't really have any say and what the course looks like on campus, so you know the file section and all of that is organized by me and the resources that are on there, so I think if they, Not necessarily had some ownership of that because I guess the resources would be uploaded by me because they're resources that I've created but if. 

Yeah no, I think it would be useful if if they if they could at least feedback on what is useful for them on canvas and actually I'm not even I don't know how much they look on canvas for stuff obviously they find out they're assignments yeah. I'm gonna talk with students about how they use canvas yeah, but I don't know if they go through. 

Section some. Where so for example with me I upload all of so there's always a PowerPoint for my lesson and I upload all of those on to canvas beforehand yeah, so for some students I've had in the past they'll download the PowerPoint beforehand and it means they've got that on their laptop and then they're taking notes from you know what I'm saying or whatever but if students don't do that. 

I'm not sure that they would go on to canvas sorry so a big part of PBL is this idea of shared knowledge like building up shared knowledge, so I was thinking for my project to. Give students basically the same functionality as teachers, so the only thing that they can't do is. 

Delete the course yeah yeah and like that's it the rest they can control they are on the course they remove themselves from the course they can do that yeah and what that means is that everyone is given this responsibility yeah and it studies have shown that when students have more expensive responsibility, they also are more interested yeah in learning yeah yeah so good what would you think like hypothetically would you be worried about as a teacher in that? 

Where did he like students messing around? Is again because I teach six warm. I can't imagine that they would do that yes for sixth one for six people for six form. Not do many problems other than if. Somebody doing and then accidentally deleted stuff from the files or whatever it was right, you know, like accidentally I really don't think anyone's gonna sabotage their own course if I'm honest that might be different lower down, especially, you know, exam classes take things a little bit more seriously yeah, I think I think something that is communal I think is a really good idea. 

I don't know how I don't know what the communal aspect of canvas might potentially be. Because again that might be that might be how I'm using it, so I'm uploading resources. There isn't really that much scope for students to kind of add to that or anything like that, well it would be something like if they find a resource online they could oh they could upload it, okay yeah yeah that I think that would be good. 

I mean, I they would upload their notes to the course things like that yeah, okay that would be good. I mean, I suppose I haven't used it before but my last school before coming here, they were gonna start introducing it but like yeah one note and class notebook yeah feels like the communal aspect of that is greater than canvas. 

So canvass yeah you can upload your notes but class notebook you can kind of all contribute to the same document right and you can see the changes that people have made. I don't know how easy that is on canvas yeah. I don't I don't know how easy that is my kind of side yeah because that I like the idea of collaboration yeah yeah I read I think that would be really good do you think it would help with learning definitely definitely and I think again, If people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards each other. 

I think that really helps would you be worried maybe that some students wouldn't take it as seriously and then because you're giving them more trust they might not they might not use it appropriately yeah. I think there's a danger like there's a danger with any group work right that there are some people who be carrying the others 100% that's definitely gonna happen so as a teacher, what would you do to like, what do you do to stop that if you I don't know if you said group projects for a level. 

Be much and. 

So I think this is the other thing of actually, you know, where where do students learn these skills and I think that if they are starting from quite a young age then by the time they get to six or one not trying to introduce something new which is what I'm very clear. 

I don't know don't want to introduce too many new things in terms of teaching and learning I think in terms of those students who take responsibility again, this is part of our ethos as school of you know, Students managing their own groups and having those dialogues about actually if you don't do your bit of work then all of us don't do very well right and I think it's I think it's a lesson that they learn together rather than mean necessarily punishing a student right so you're saying just because, You're giving them responsibility gel hold each other accountable. 

Yeah. I think the whole each other account. Earned. You know, they will learn. Mistake. Actually they need to all take responsibility and contribute and that kind of thing. And I think that is part of the learning process. So, I wouldn't necessarily from the outset be thinking right how am I going to punish the kid who's not doing the work? 

Right. You're just thinking it'll work out. Yeah. I mean, of course I would you know, and, It's how. Fused it. So if, I stick that's when students don't take it seriously whereas if it's focused. So it means that you're kind of just doing it as a one-off, right? It's not embedded and a really important part of the curriculum, right? 

Whereas if it's something that is integral to how somebody is going to be assessed then they're probably going to take a little bit more seriously. Whereas at the moment, if I'm using it. I'm using it as a one-off to do a group project together. Right. But they know that at the end of the day, they're assessed through an exam. 

Yeah, you know, so they don't really care how they've done in a group. Yeah, so I think in terms of the product both learning and all of that group work if this is where the six to eight curriculum could be really interesting where if it's part of their assessment process then they're going to be learning those skills and taking responsibility and having a bit of accountability. 

Which I think is more difficult later on. When they know that it's not leading to anything. Concrete like the grade. Right. Okay, well great, thank you tackle. How are you very useful? You can actually. Yeah. And have.
